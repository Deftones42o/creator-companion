## Summary

Adds Project Templates for Unity 2019

<!--truncate-->

## Changes

- We've added templates for making new projects with Unity 2019 and clarified that the new templates are for Unity 2022, since those require pre-release packages to be enabled.

## Download

If you already installed the Creator Companion, simply open it and click **Update**.

To install the Creator Companion, download the latest version from the [official download page](https://vrchat.com/home/download).

However, if a direct link to this version is needed, it can be found at [VRChat_Creator_Companion_Setup_2.2.1.exe](https://vrcpm.vrchat.cloud/vcc/Builds/2.2.1/VRChat_CreatorCompanion_Setup_2.2.1.exe).
